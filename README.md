Easy Configuring a SoftrockSDR receiver to use with the WebSDR
I am not a Linux expert by any means. I have a PhD, but My experience is clinical Geneticsbut. I am very passionate about radio and electronics. Ham radio has a sweet spot in my heart. 
Over the last several months, I've been struggling trying to set up my Websdr. Finally,  I believe I got it working.
 It's not the best out there, but it seems to be performing correctly. 
Sadly, I couldn't find any reliable help.
The little information I was able to gather from the web was too vague me; I've wasted so much time. 
Finally I was able to get somewhere.
So, my intention here is to help someone that perhaps still struggling with Tony Parks Softrocks receivers.
like I said, I don't want to go deep into the subject of how everything was coded.  For that, it would be best for you to contact directly Dr. Tjerk Devrous, the creator of the WebSDR project.
 He, and only he, holds the key to the program and decides who can have it.
